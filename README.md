Notes

Step 1
- Set up some things for later such as DI and Ctrl+C
 - Was much easier to just do from the start than figure it out later
- In order to run tests 
  - Run from terminal by cd <RootPath>/tests
  - Then dotnet test

- Attempted to get it into a single solution with no success
- Imperfect code, while not fantastic, can be better than broken code
