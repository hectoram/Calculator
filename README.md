Notes

Step 1
- Set up some things for later such as DI and Ctrl+C
 - Was much easier to just do from the start than figure it out later
- In order to run tests 
  - Run from terminal by cd <RootPath>/tests
  - Then dotnet test

- Attempted to get it into a single solution with no success
- Imperfect code, while not fantastic, can be better than broken code


Final Commit notes: 
- Possible flag usage -d (delimiter) -o (Opperation) -b (UpperBound) -n (Negative Allowance T|F)
  - Supported ops Multiply, divide, add, subtract
  - Example: -b=1005-n=f-o=div||6,2
- Upfront design saves a lot of time. Stretch goal #3 hits hard if not planned for.
